# Codes for estimating the parameters of frailty models for repairable systems under imperfect repair

## The repository

This repository contains the codes implemented from the theory presented in Manuscript "Reliability analysis of multiple repairable systems under imperfect repair and unobserved heterogeneity", as well as the databases used in that work.
